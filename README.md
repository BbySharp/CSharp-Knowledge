## 📘 Detailed Sections

### 1️⃣ Basics (💡 Getting Started)
Start here to learn the **fundamentals of C#**. Master the basics before moving on to more advanced concepts.

- **Variables**: Understand data types and variable declarations.
- **Loops**: Learn about `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
- **Conditions**: Practice conditional statements (`if-else`, `switch`).
- **Arrays**: Introduction to arrays and their operations.
- **Functions**: Writing reusable methods in C#.
- **Operators**: Use arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.

---

### 2️⃣ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (🛠️ Building Blocks)
Deep dive into **Object-Oriented Programming** principles. Learn how to build scalable, maintainable software using OOP.

- **Classes and Objects**: Define and use custom classes and objects.
- **Encapsulation**: Protect your data with access modifiers (`public`, `private`).
- **Inheritance**: Reuse code by creating a class hierarchy.
- **Polymorphism**: Overload and override methods for flexibility.
- **Abstract Classes & Interfaces**: Use abstraction to create flexible designs.

---

### 3️⃣ Data Structures (📊 Organizing Data)
Learn about common data structures and how to manipulate them efficiently.

- **Lists**: Work with dynamic collections.
- **Dictionaries**: Store and retrieve key-value pairs.
- **Stacks**: Implement Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) operations.
- **Queues**: Implement First-In-First-Out (FIFO) operations.
- **Linked Lists**: Learn about singly and doubly linked lists.

---

### 4️⃣ Exception Handling (🛡️ Error Management)
Handling errors gracefully is a must for any robust application. Learn to manage exceptions and create custom error messages.

- **Try-Catch-Finally**: Catch and handle runtime exceptions.
- **Custom Exceptions**: Create your own exception classes.
- **Exception Hierarchy**: Explore the built-in hierarchy of exception types.

---

### 5️⃣ LINQ (🔍 Data Querying)
**LINQ** (Language Integrated Query) allows you to query collections like databases. This section covers:

- **Basic Queries**: Filter and select data from collections.
- **Aggregations**: Perform operations like `Sum`, `Count`, and `Average`.
- **Grouping and Joining**: Group data by keys and join multiple collections.

---

### 6️⃣ Asynchronous Programming (⚙️ Performance Boost)
Learn how to handle long-running tasks without blocking the main thread using **async** and **await**.

- **Async/Await**: Write asynchronous code in a clean and readable way.
- **Tasks**: Manage tasks and background processes.
- **Parallel Programming**: Execute multiple operations concurrently.

---

### 7️⃣ Delegates and Events (📣 Event-Driven Programming)
Delegates and events are crucial in building **event-driven** systems.

- **Delegates**: Pass methods as parameters.
- **Events**: Trigger and handle events in C#.
- **Func, Action, Predicate**: Built-in delegates for common use cases.

---

### 8️⃣ Design Patterns (🎨 Best Practices)
Learn industry-standard **design patterns** to write better, more maintainable code.

- **Singleton**: Ensure a class has only one instance.
- **Factory**: Encapsulate object creation logic.
- **Observer**: Implement the observer pattern for event-driven systems.
- **Dependency Injection**: Decouple dependencies for better testability and flexibility.

---

### 9️⃣ File I/O (📂 File Management)
Learn how to read and write files, and serialize/deserialize objects.

- **Reading and Writing Files**: Manipulate file data with `StreamReader` and `StreamWriter`.
- **Serialization**: Convert objects into byte streams and vice versa.
- **JSON/XML**: Work with JSON and XML formats for data exchange.

---

### 🔟 Databases (💾 Persistent Storage)
Working with databases is an essential skill for any developer.

- **SQL Basics**: Perform basic CRUD operations using SQL.
- **Entity Framework**: Use Entity Framework to work with relational data in an object-oriented way.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete data from databases.
